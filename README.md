Working Procedure

1. Sensor Data Simulation (Wokwi)
   ğŸ’   Simulate the following sensors using Wokwi:
   ğŸ’  `DHT22` for temperature and humidity
   ğŸ’  `Potentiometer` for soil moisture
   ğŸ’  `Button` as a rain sensor
   ğŸ’  `Buzzer` and `LED` for pest alert
   ğŸ’   Use an OLED display to show sensor readings in real-time.

2. Sensor Data Collection
   ğŸ’  Values from the sensors (simulated in Wokwi) are read in the code.
   ğŸ’  These include:
   ğŸ’  Temperature (Â°C)
   ğŸ’  Humidity (%)
   ğŸ’  Soil Moisture (%)
   ğŸ’  Rain Detected (Yes/No)

3. Data Transmission (Software-Based Simulation)
   ğŸ’  Since the project is software-based, sensor values are either stored in a `.json` file or accessed directly through the backend code (`app.py`).
   ğŸ’  No physical ESP32 or Wi-Fi module is used.

4. Backend Processing (Python Flask)
   ğŸ’  The `app.py` file reads the sensor data.
   ğŸ’  Based on predefined thresholds, it:
   ğŸ’  Suggests suitable crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize)
   ğŸ’  Triggers pest alerts if humidity is high or moisture conditions are ideal for pests

5. Website Display (Frontend)
   ğŸ’  The frontend (`index.html`, `script.js`) fetches data from the backend.
   ğŸ’  Displays:
   ğŸ’  Live sensor values
   ğŸ’  Suggested crops
   ğŸ’  Pest alerts (with buzzer and LED simulated visually)

6. Notification Logic
   ğŸ’  If pest-prone weather is detected:
   ğŸ’  A buzzer is activated (simulated)
   ğŸ’  LED turns on (simulated)
   ğŸ’  A red alert is shown on the website
   ğŸ’  If all conditions are normal:
   ğŸ’  A green message is displayed: "Crops are safe"

7. Final Output
   ğŸ’  Users can monitor weather, soil, and pest risk from a single dashboard.
   ğŸ’  Helps in early pest management and better crop planning.
